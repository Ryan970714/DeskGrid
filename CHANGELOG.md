# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Right-click an item in an open folder for the menu Explorer shows for it (Open, Send to, Cut, Copy, Delete,
  Properties and whatever other apps add; hold Shift for the extra commands). Rename is not in it.
- **New folder…** in the right-click menu of a folder and of the name bar of an open folder.
- **Delete folder…** from the name bar of an open folder and from a folder's entry in the all-folders list, so a
  folder can be deleted without going back to the desktop or the root folder.
- The first run asks whether DeskGrid should start with Windows. If Windows refuses to change the start-up entry, the
  tray menu now says so.

### Changed

- Start with Windows: the entry now carries `--autostart` (older entries are updated on the next start). A start at
  sign-in waits, up to 45 seconds, until Explorer has laid out the desktop icons before the folders are placed.

### Fixed

- A start at sign-in, before Explorer had put the desktop icons in place, could snap the folders onto the fallback grid
  and save those positions over the real ones. Without the icon grid, folders now stay where they were.
- Deleting a folder left its taskbar shortcut and icon in `%APPDATA%\DeskGrid\Pins`.

### Documentation

- README: what to do when Windows says "An Application Control policy has blocked this file" (Smart App Control).

## 0.3.0

### Added

- Folder names get a dark halo while the wallpaper behind them is light, so white names stay readable.
- Delete a folder from the desktop: right-click it → **Delete folder…**. The folder goes to the Recycle Bin. A new
  setting decides what happens to the items inside: they are moved to the desktop first (the default), or deleted
  along with the folder.
- Drag a desktop icon onto another one and the two become a new folder, which takes the place of the icon dropped
  on. Folders on the desktop are left alone: dropping onto one still moves the file into it.

### Removed

- The "new folder" tile on the desktop. New folders come from the tray menu or from dropping one desktop icon on
  another; dropping files on the tile to make a folder for them is gone with it.

### Fixed

- Dragging a folder on the desktop while its panel was open left the panel behind; it now closes.

## 0.2.5

### Added

- A desktop icon that lands on a widget (Windows places a new shortcut in what it thinks is a free cell, or an icon is
  dragged there) moves to the nearest free cell. With "Auto arrange icons" on, icons can't be moved, so the widget
  moves instead.

### Fixed

- A panel opened near the bottom of the screen cut off the names in its last row when it grew, for example when a
  folder with more items was opened from the folder list.
- The taskbar shortcut to all folders couldn't be pinned while (or after) the shortcut from 0.2.2 and earlier was
  pinned; it now has its own AppUserModelID.
- Dragging an item in a panel is smoother: the drag ghost no longer waits for a WPF frame each time it moves.

## 0.2.4

### Changed

- The new folder dialog and the update dialog have the same Fluent look as the settings window: they follow the
  system light or dark mode and group their content into a rounded card.

## 0.2.3

### Changed

- The settings window uses the Fluent look: settings are grouped into rounded cards, and the window follows the system
  light or dark mode.

### Fixed

- The taskbar shortcut to all folders is now named "DeskGrid" in every language; a shortcut left under the old name
  is removed when it is created again. A taskbar pin made from the old shortcut keeps its name: unpin it and pin the
  new one.
- The plus on the "new folder" tile on the desktop sat off the tile's center.
- Switching from the folder list to a folder with more items, or a folder gaining items while its panel was open,
  didn't resize the panel.
- Clicking a taskbar pin while its panel was open reopened the panel instead of closing it.
- After a drag in a panel, a rescan held back during the drag could undo the new order.
- Dropping something into a panel that couldn't be added left the gap opened for it.

## 0.2.2

### Changed

- The Update button now does the whole update in one dialog and shows its status live: the download with percent and
  size, then verifying the checksum, then installing and restarting. If the swap fails, the error is shown in the
  dialog and the update can be retried, instead of opening the release page.

## 0.2.1

### Fixed

- Shortcuts to Microsoft Store apps (for example Slack and WhatsApp) showed a blank document icon in widget previews
  and panels. These shortcuts have no file path, only an AppUserModelID, so the Shell was asked for the icon of the
  `.lnk` file itself. DeskGrid now looks the app up in the Apps folder and asks for its logo. Some packages have no logo
  of the size the icon-only request wants (WhatsApp); for those the request is repeated without icon-only, which finds
  a smaller logo.
- Dragging a folder in the "all folders" panel lifted only its preview image, which looked enlarged and lost the
  translucent tile under it. The drag ghost now carries the tile with the same padding as the grid cell.

### Added

- The folders in the "all folders" panel (opened from the taskbar) can be rearranged by dragging, with the same sliding
  animation as items inside a folder. The order is saved in `config.json` as `folderOrder`, new folders go last, and a
  renamed folder keeps its place. Dragging a folder never moves or copies it on disk.

### Changed

- The title of the "all folders" panel is now "DeskGrid".

## 修正紀錄（繁體中文）

### 0.2.5

#### 新增

- 桌面圖示落到 widget 上時（Windows 把新捷徑放進它以為的空格，或圖示被拖過去），自動移到最近的空格。開啟「自動排列圖示」時圖示移不動，改由 widget 讓開。

#### 修正

- 面板開在螢幕底部附近時，內容變多（例如從資料夾列表點進項目較多的資料夾）會切掉最後一列的名稱。
- 0.2.2 以前的「所有資料夾」捷徑釘在工作列時（或取消後），新的捷徑無法釘選；現在改用自己的 AppUserModelID。
- 面板內拖曳更順：拖曳影子移動時不再等 WPF 畫一幀。

### 0.2.4

#### 變更

- 新增資料夾對話框與更新對話框改用與設定視窗相同的 Fluent 外觀：跟隨系統淺色 / 深色模式，內容放在圓角卡片中。

### 0.2.3

#### 變更

- 設定視窗改用 Fluent 外觀：設定分組成圓角卡片，並跟隨系統淺色 / 深色模式。

#### 修正

- 「所有資料夾」的工作列捷徑在任何語言下都叫「DeskGrid」；重新建立時會刪掉舊名稱的捷徑。用舊捷徑釘選的工作列按鈕
  名稱不會變，請取消釘選後改釘新的。
- 桌面上「新增資料夾」磚的 + 不在正中間。
- 從資料夾列表點進項目較多的資料夾，或面板開著時資料夾新增了項目，面板大小沒有跟著變。
- 面板開著時再點工作列按鈕，面板會重新打開而不是收合。
- 面板內拖曳後，拖曳中延後的重掃可能蓋掉新的排序。
- 拖進面板但沒有任何項目可加入時，為它開的缺口不會合起來。

### 0.2.2

#### 變更

- 「更新」按鈕現在在同一個對話框內完成整個更新，並即時顯示狀態：下載（百分比與大小）、驗證校驗碼、安裝並重新啟動。
  換檔失敗時錯誤會顯示在對話框內，可以重試，不再改開 release 頁面。

### 0.2.1

#### 修正

- Microsoft Store App（例如 Slack、WhatsApp）的捷徑在 widget 預覽與面板中顯示空白文件圖示。這類捷徑沒有檔案路徑，
  只有 AppUserModelID，先前是對 `.lnk` 檔案本身要圖示。現在改為在「應用程式」資料夾中找到該 App 並取得它的 logo。
  部分套件（WhatsApp）沒有 icon-only 要求的尺寸，此時改用不帶 icon-only 的要求，取得較小的 logo。
- 在「所有資料夾」面板拖曳資料夾時，影子只有預覽圖，看起來被放大且少了底下的半透明底板。影子現在帶著底板，內距與格子相同。

#### 新增

- 「所有資料夾」面板（從工作列開啟）中的資料夾可以拖曳排序，滑動動畫與資料夾內項目排序相同。順序存在
  `config.json` 的 `folderOrder`，新資料夾排最後，資料夾改名後順位不變。拖曳資料夾不會在磁碟上移動或複製它。

#### 變更

- 「所有資料夾」面板的標題改為「DeskGrid」。
